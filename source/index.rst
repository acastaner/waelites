Hall of Revealed Mysteries
============================

The goal of this website is to provide in-depth, accurate and solid information about all the advanced facets of Pillars of Eternity. This documentation is maintained by a group of Waelites devoted to discovering and revealing Knowledge. As Wael would command it, all of this documentation is free to use and shared by anyone (this means it's all under a Creative Commons license, if you didn't get that). Our Saint Patron is Wael, god of Knowedge and yada-yada and recognize His and only His Wisdom (we are not related to Obsidian Entertainment or Paradox Interactive in any way, except we bought their games, I guess).
