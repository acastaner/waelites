Ectopsychic Echo

| Speed: Average
| Range: 12m
| Duration: 10 sec
| Interrupt: 0.5 sec (Average)
| Effects:

* Foe Beam: 20-30 Crush Damage | Accuracy (+5) vs. Reflex per 1.0 sec

This spell targets an ally of the Cipher. Any foe caught between them, in the path of the beam, will suffer 20 to 30 Crush Damage per second - that's a total of 200-300 of damage over the period of the spell. Each tick of the spell can miss, graze, hit or crit, individually for each enemy affected by it. Consequently, the damage of this spell can be very high (some would say "insanely high"). The tradeoff is of course that the cipher and her ally have to be correctly positionned, which may prove difficult, but the reward can be quite high.
